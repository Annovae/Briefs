<h1>Briefs</h1>

<p>The Briefs toolkit was created for rapidly building &amp; iterating app prototypes for the iPhone. These prototypes run directly on the phone, like actual apps, but require much less time and code to produce. Less code means faster cycles and cheaper development.</p>

<p>The purpose of Briefs is to create better apps that have a tested interaction design before they are built. Unlike traditional mockups, briefs are used just like an actual app not just seen. And because they use the same frameworks that regular apps are built upon, briefs can potentially take advantage of animation, device rotation and gestures. You can even design the experience around app interruption due to an incoming phone call. Thinking about these interactions will ensure a more thought out experience for your users.</p>

<h1>Design</h1>

<p>At it's core, each brief is merely a text file that references a series of static images. These text files carry the extension <code>.brieflist</code> and can be compacted, which dereferences the images embedding the raw data into the brief. This allows for only a single file to be transferred between you and your testers.</p>

<h2>Scenes</h2>

<p>The organization of a brief is divided into <code>scenes</code> which represent a single state for any given screen inside of your application. Each <code>scene</code> contains a transition style that controls how the image associated with the <code>scene</code> appears and exits.</p>

<h2>Actors</h2>

<p>Controls and events are modeled as <code>actors</code> that belong to a given <code>scene</code>. An <code>actor</code> can also contain an image reference that is optional. The location, size and action must all be defined for an <code>actor</code>. (0,0) starts in the top-left and the size is specified in pixels.</p>

<h2>Briefcasts</h2>

<p>A <code>briefcast</code> is a way to share your briefs with the world. It's a standard RSS 2.0 feed that uses enclosures (much like podcasts) to embed briefs inside. The <code>briefs.app</code> can read this feed and allows you to download the brief onto your device. With <code>briefcasts</code> you don't need Xcode to embed your briefs: instead copy new versions of your briefs to your <code>briefcast</code>, then pull them down on the device.</p>
