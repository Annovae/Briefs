    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>1. How do I exit a running brief?</strong></p>
    <p>Tap and hold anywhere on the screen for about 1 second, then a dialog will appear.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Where is the iPad version?</strong></p>
    <p>We have something special planned for the iPad version. Right now Briefs is on sale for half-price until we release the iPad version. When it's released, it will be a free upgrade (a Universal app) for all existing users.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. I don't like BS, is there a more visual editor planned?</strong></p>
    <p>There are plans to build a visual, drag &amp; drop style editor for both the iPad and the Mac. However, I'm only one developer and I'm picky about details.</p><p>In the meantime, feel free to check out <a href="http://giveabrief.com/">http://giveabrief.com/+</a> to find out how you can download the source and build the visual editor of your dreams. After all, Briefs is open-source software. I even pulled out the code for the file format into it's own library. Wasn't that nice?</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Why are you charging so much? Isn't it open-source?</strong></p>
    <p>Open source on the iPhone does not mean free. In fact, Apple requires anyone who wants to put software on the device without going through the App store to pay $100/year for that priviledge. So, that means I get to have a completely open-source app for developers and still make money. Isn't that dandy?</p>
